# Artificial Neural Networks

This is a personal project containing implementations of various types of artificial neural networks. The goal is to understand common design patterns and technical frameworks, as well as explore new varieties of neural networks.

The approach is to write simple, reproducible and easily readable implementations of each type of neural network.
